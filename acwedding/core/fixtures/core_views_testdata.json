Claire needed to be in Cleveland early on August 16 for a law seminar, so we decided to make a short trip out of it and go to Cleveland on the 15th. We planned to go to the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo that day for something to do. Seeing an opportunity to accomplish the fabled elephant proposal, Adam brought the ring (which he'd bought a few weeks prior) in a special pink elephant ring box.\r\n\r\nThe start of a string of coincidences that made the day especially memorable was \"Colonel Hathi's March\" (aka \"the elephant song from The Jungle Book\") being picked on shuffle from 1000s of songs just as we drove into the zoo entrance.",
